# Assignment Instructions
The purpose of this assignment is to apply Python to the preliminary tasks of data exploration and analysis. To demonstrate completion of this assignment, create a Microsoft Word document with your working code, screenshots of program results, and written answers to questions. Writing should be professional and rigorous, and include scientific/mathematical justification, where appropriate, for all conclusions reached. Upload your final Jupyter notebook and Word document to the digital classroom when complete.

In 250-500 words, answer the following:
1. Import the necessary libraries in Python that will allow you to use data frames, lists, load datasets, and plots.
2. Load your dataset into a data frame using the pandas library, then display the first 10 rows of your data.
3. Perform univariate analysis on your loaded dataset using the describe function. Report the results.
4. Based on the previous step results, spot and interpret any outliers (negative or positive skewness) and/or missing data.
5. For each outlier you spotted in the previous step, plot it into a scatter plot using the seaborn library. Show and interpret the graphs.
6. Perform an outlier treatment to the variables that have outliers. Report and explain the results.
7. Perform missing values imputation to the variables that have missing values. Explain which method you used and why. Report the results
8. Perform bivariate analysis to study the strength of the correlation among your variables. Hint: use scatter plots or correlation matrix methods to explain the relationship between two variables. Report and interpret the results.
9. Based on the results reported in the previous step, perform data transformation, as needed, to transform a relationship from nonlinear to linear. Explain your decision on the transformation method used here.
10. Show and explain how you would handle qualitative data in your dataset. Hint: use Dummy variables.
11. Test for multicollinearity in the dataset using the variance_inflation_factor() function. Report the VIF values and interpret the results.

APA style is not required, but solid academic writing is expected. This assignment uses a rubric. Please review the rubric prior to beginning the assignment to become familiar with the expectations for successful completion. You are not required to submit this assignment to LopesWrite.
